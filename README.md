# Sequence-Detector-using-verilog
A Sequence Detector designed and implemented using Verilog HDL. The project demonstrates how Finite State Machines (FSMs) (Moore and Mealy) can be applied to detect specific bit patterns (like 1010). Includes Verilog code, testbenches, and simulations. Useful for understanding digital design, pattern recognition, and FPGA/ASIC implementations.
